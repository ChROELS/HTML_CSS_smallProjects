# HTML_CSS_smallProjects
For an introductory course on front-end development at Intec Brussel, I choose to work on the theme of a membership form for a skiclub.

Sliding boxes is a short animation of four boxes moving in a squared area without hitting each other before returning to their place. 
It was a personal project that I developed after having followed tutorials on html, css and js fundamentals on Sololearn.com.

Enter Button is another short project I did to improve my coding skills in jQuery.
