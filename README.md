# HTML_CSS_smallProjects
HTMLForm and CSSForm files are related to an introductory course on front-end that I followed at Intec Brussel. 
I choose to work on the theme of a membership form for a skiclub.

Sliding boxes is a short animation of four boxes moving in a squared area without hitting each other before returning to their place. 
It was a personal project that I developed after having followed tutorials on html,css and js on Sololearn.com.
